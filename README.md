**NB:** Development is in process. See [JS Player Pivotal Tracker page](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/561405) to see what happens in project when you read this.

To use JS player in current state, download or copy from the cloned repository:

 * `vendor/matrix.js`
 * `anm.player.js`
 * [Optional] `anm.collisions.js` (if you plan to test collisions / point-contains / intersections with your shapes) 
 * [Optional] `anm.builder.js` (allows to build animations in a functional way)
 * [Optional] `animatron_import.js` (allows to load animations from Animatron tool)
 * [Optional] `json2.js` (JSON parser, if target broswer not supports it (currently required only for Animatron Import)) 
   
And add them in the same order to your page header. Don't forget the [`LICENSE`](https://github.com/Animatron/player/blob/master/LICENSE#files) :).
