v0.9.1501 / Fri Oct 04 2013 18:35:07 +0200 / 21a949ac105336bde8e65322c9fd0789b5580b72
=====================================================================================

Implemented a remote resource manager (`__anm.resource_manager`), which:

* Allows to subscribe with any number of callbacks to any number of resources and they'll be called when each of these resources was either loaded or failed to load.
* Stores the cache of all requested resources among with waiting and errors queue
* Do not loads any resource with it's own code, just requires a loader function.

Integrated it to `Sheet` class and `audio.js` module.

Also:

* New `RES_LOADING` state for the player
* New `RES_LOAD` event for the player which fires when player started to load resources
* `LOAD` is now fired only when all remote resources (if there were any) were loaded or failed

How to use:

* Get `__anm.resource_manager` instance
* When you need to load a resource, call `.loadOrGet` method of resource manager with:
    * URL of the resource
    * Loader function (it will not be called if resource is already in the cache) which gets `onsuccess` and `onerror` callbacks as arguments and should call them in the corresponding situation (like deferred AJAX call)
    * Callback function which gets the resource value when it was successfully loaded
* To listen for specific resources to complete loading, call `.subscribe` method with array of required URLs and a callback (or array of callbacks) to be called when these resources are loaded or failed to load (or some loaded and some failed)
* If you have a local static resource and some subscriber to it's URL, just call `.trigger` method with URL and it's resource to force resource manager to notify subscribers for this resource. If it failed to load, call `.error` method with URL and error instance

===================================================================================

Totally new controls design.

Among with that:

* new player states: `C.LOADING` (while loading a scene) and `C.ERROR` (when error was fired). In addition to the well-known old ones: `C.PLAYING`, `C.PAUSED`, `C.STOPPED` and `C.NOTHING`
* type of the last load target (internal, currently) is stored now: `C.LT_BUILDER`, `C.LT_SCENE`, `C.LT_CLIPS`, `C.LT_URL` and `C.LT_IMPORT`
* `InfoBlock` is completely controlled by `Controls` — so, when controls are disabled, there's also will be no info block.
* Now we know how to draw the Animatron Guy (on cached canvas)
* Improved test mocks and tests themselves

Fixes:

* Swap two importers back, the compact-format importer is now in `animatron.js` bundle and is named `AnimatronImporter` (was in `animatron-publish.js` bundle and was named `AnimatronPublishImporter`), and the full-format importer is `AnimatronIntactImporter` and lays in `animatron-intact.js` bundle. It affects several files, including `go` page.
* Add handling player PAUSE event in audio module

**Major** change is that ALL types of the modifiers now receive _relative time_.

The another **major** change is that _tweens_ are TOTALLY identical to _band-restricted modifiers_ now, they just have predefined functions.

This version will **BREAK** most of the code used with previous versions. The version just before these changes has `v0.245` tag, so it is safe to switch to it and your code will work properly, but w

So, developers who use the engine should change their code accordingly, and I recommend to do it in a separate branch, use `v0.245` and `v0.246b` tags to checkout and switch versions of player.

Some new aggressive errors may appear while using new code, please report it to me, by e-mail or through issues, I'll try to fix them asap.

Final `v0.246` version will fix `AnimatronImporter`, new-found bugs and include docs. If you feel unsafe, you may wait to the final `v0.246` version which should fix bugs unrelated to animations and those

* tweens now act as a band-restricted modifiers, so they get value of `0` before their band wasn't started and value of `1` after their band; please keep that in mind when you use overlapping modifiers or
* simple modifiers now take time `t` in range of `0..1`, second argument is `duration`, so to get the actual value you should use `t * duration`; `data` is the _third_ argument now.
* default band for any empty element is back to `0..10`, before it was `0..MAX_INT` — it was changed back since all modifiers now get `0..1` of `t` and in previous version empty elements got the very smal
* state is now totally clean in modifiers when it comes inside on new frame, so code like `this.x += 5` will not work (and failed to work before, but it is another story), please use previous state that i

Modifiers types:

* `b().modify(function(t, [duration[, data]]) { ... })` — now modifier takes `t` in range `0..1`, and takes `duration`, which is duration of the element band (same to `this.$.duration()`).
* `b().modify([x, y], function(t, [duration[, data]]) { ... })`, will call a modifier through the inner band, getting _value from `0..1`_ in the duration of the band `[x, y]`, like tweens. It is important
* `b().modify(my_t, function(t, [duration[, data]]) { ... })` will call a modifier at `my_t` time or a bit later, if framerate is low, and will get actual time when it was called. `my_t` is like a band-ti

See example from [Previous PR#53](https://github.com/Animatron/player/pull/56) to get vision of new types of modifiers.

Other changes:

* Tweens are equal to band-modifiers, their functions are also changed accordingly
* Default band for empty element is now `0..10`
* It is now possible to pass easing for any modifier (I should also mention it in docs)
* Element state is now cleared on every frame (previously it was cloned and passed to new-frame modifiers)
* `scene.duration` and elements' bands calculation fixes, default band for the element is now [0, 10]
* More bands, scene & element duration tests, so they should work more polished
* Partly refactored errors to be collected in a single object

`v0.247` is planned to include relative-modifiers, so:

    b().band([0, 5]).modify([2.5, 4], function(t) { ... })
    b().band([0, 5]).rmodify([1/2, 4/5], function(t) { ... })

will be equal, and the same with triggers:

    b().band([0, 5]).modify(2.5, function(t) { ... })
    b().band([0, 5]).rmodify(1/2, function(t) { ... })
