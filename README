Licensed under MIT License, see `LICENSE` file.

See [API.md](https://github.com/Animatron/player/blob/master/API.md) for description on current API state (be aware, it may appear not updated to the _real_ current state).

**NB:** Development is in early process.

Run `examples/demo.html` to see it in action.

To use JS player in current state, download or copy from the cloned repository:

And add them in the same order to your page header. Don't forget the `LICENSE` :).
